What does it do?
================

In technical articles it is sometimes necessary to embed code snippets into the
text of a page. To improve the readability of the snippets, the syntax
highlighting of code is appreciated - as in modern IDEs.

The extension provides a new content element to achieve this goal. You can
choose between several themes.
